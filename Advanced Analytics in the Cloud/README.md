# Advanced Analytics in the Cloud demos

## Session Walkthrough
Since this session focusses on building an experiment in Azure Machine Learning Studio the **session_walkthrough.txt** file should be used to reproduce the demos inside the session.

If you are unable to configure a connection to a on-premises SQL Server Instance you can use the **automobiles.csv** file since it holds the same data as the on-premises source I showed. You can upload the .csv file inside Azure Machine Learning Studio and drag it into the canvas as a Data Source and continue the walkthrough from line 13 onwards.
