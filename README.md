# Session Repository

Welcome to my session repository.
Inside this repository the slides, demos and additional materials can be found which I used during an event.

Want to see the session materials for a specific event?
All events are ordered into seperate folders.

Got a question about a session or want to learn more about the topic we discussed?
You can contact me through Twitter at [@evdlaar](https://www.twitter.com/evdlaar)!

Wondering where you can find the materials for the Crazy Data Science sessions?
They can be found on their own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/crzydatascience)
